# WOTR-FP-BOT
//Where the program ask you for the Sleep Grade (is the first question) press i to get the instructions. This action can be performed every time you open the program.

//General things about this program
	 
	/*
	    This bot is an almost fully automatic one, where you have just to answer every turn to circa 5 questions and press any key in the Action Resolution to take an action
		It's not a very sofisticated one, just follow the actions bellow (and depending on the Action Dice)
		The bot it's not fully tested, so probably in real games few things will not be like he the bot knows, in this case  close it and play with yourself:)
		 -that's because i wanted to be as automatic as possible and look fancy
		The bot will kill one damage of corruption if random companion is choosed: so point is bot disadvantage
		The Dice are auto-randomized by the program, so you shouldn't introduce them every round
	    
	The General Actions that the program does are:
		  -Move the Fellowship trought the shortest route
	      -Bring Gandalf the White as quickly as he can and move him to fangorn
		  -Start with GTG as the guide, and after he left Strider becomes the Guide(ATENTION!-if Strider in the fellowship and he has choosed as the random Companion, choose another companion,the program is not maked to recognize this (!BUT the program will ask you if Strider is died at the final of a turn): in this way the bot will get some pretty luck and will have a chance to win you
		  -Separate Strider if Dead Men of Dunhharow card is in the fp hand
		  -Keep the rest of companions in the Fellowship to absorb Corruption 
	      -When it comes to PALANTIR (-play a card if possible,if not draw one)
		  
	
	//IF THE BOT CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME ARE WRONG - just ignore them, this doesn t affect so much the dice actions, so in this case just read the actions
